# Troubleshooting

## Recovering a lost Pill token

In case you've lost your Pill token, you will need to connect your Pill to your
computer using an USB cable and visit
[pill.karmen.tech](http://pill.karmen.tech) with your web browser once it boots
up after a while. Your token will be displayed there.

## My Pill is connected to my computer but pill.karmen.tech address can't be reached

Under some rare circumstances, DNS resolution might fail. If that's what you're
experiencing, type the raw IP adress [169.254.13.1](http://169.254.13.1) instead
of *pill.karmen.tech* and see if this works.

## None of pill.karmen.tech and 169.254.13.1 is accessible on my Windows 10 computer

Some people have reported Pill connection problems on their Windows 10 computer.
If you've **connected your Pill box to your computer**, waited for it to **boot
up** properly (saw it blinking with blue light which then stopped) and still
**can't reach Pill on the aforementioned addresses**, follow [this
guide](pill-win10.md) which should help you solve the issue.

## My Pill cannot be found on the WiFi network

Make sure you use 2.4GHz network, 5GHz networks are not currently supported by
Karmen Pill.

## My Pill just won't work with my printer
